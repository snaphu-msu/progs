# Progenitor sets

Put data for progenitor model sets here.

The directory name must match the `set_name` defined in `progs/config/`.

For example, the Sukhbold 2016 set (`set_name='sukhbold_2016'`) should look as follows:

```
progenitor_sets
│
└───sukhbold_2016
|   |   s9.0_presn
|   │   s9.5_presn
|   │   ...
```
